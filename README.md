Teknik Android App

The goal of this app is to bring Teknik's services to Android. Currently this includes the following:

* Support reading the Teknik blog/news from in-app.
* The upload service
* The paste service
* The URL shortening service

Future plans:

* I would like to also develop an iOS version in the future, although there is no current plan for this as of yet.
* Include all services provided by Teknik - Currently, the focus is on providing the services that the API supports.
* Integrate all of Teknik's main features with the app. This will include features such as account management.
